/**
 * "Rackable" — a Device Inventory entry that describes a piece of hardware you
 * could screw into a rack, as opposed to something virtual, mesh-attached or
 * purely a canvas annotation.
 *
 * An exclusion list, not an allow list: new hardware types should be rackable
 * by default and only the obviously non-physical kinds opt out. A device with
 * no `suggested_type` at all (a bare IP-scan hit) stays rackable — the scanner
 * simply has not named it yet.
 *
 * Mirrors `UNRACKABLE_TYPES` in `custom_components/homelable/racks.py`, which
 * is what `homelable/racks/inventory` filters on; `tests/test_racks.py` fails
 * the Python suite when the two drift. Keeping them equal is what makes the
 * inventory modal's Rackable filter show exactly the rows the rack tray offers.
